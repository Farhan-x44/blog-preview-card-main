## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

i learnt how to center a DIV properly and how to use flexbox much better

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css 
  .container {
    width: 350px;
    height: auto;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    border-radius: 10px;
    border-right: 7px solid #000;
    border-bottom: 7px solid #000;
    border-top: 1px solid #000;
    border-left: 1px solid #000;
    line-height: 1.5;
}


### Continued development

I want to learn more about layout and how to write a more cleaner html and css


### Useful resources
